# Covid-19 Tracker
A tracker application that visualises real time data for Covid-19 total cases, recoveries and deaths. The app uses the api at https://covid19.mathdro.id/api and React. Global data is visualised using a graph between total number and dates. Country wise data is visalised using bar charts.

## Usage
- Hover over the graphs to see exact numbers.
- Click `**Infected** or **Deaths** to toggle the coresponding graphs
- Use the drop down menu right above the graph to change countries.

## What I learnt
- React Components, React Hooks
- Handle API calls
- Visualisation of JSON data from fetched API
- Animations
- Material UI
